# My coding competition solutions
Set of my solutions (4 python programs, 1 C++ program) to Coding League organized by Centrum Mistrzostwa Informatycznego in 2022.
I had 2 weeks to solve each task. The tasks were progressively harder.
I'm planning to refactor the code in near future, because some of variable names are written in Polish and some are in English.
When I was creating the code I was only trying to make it work as good and as quick as possible. The code itself is chaotic and hard to read but it works.

Solutions were judged by their time complexity.
The results: 
I task: 84/100 
II task: 25/100 (I couldn't come up with a good solution, most of the other participants got results ranging form 0 to 10)
III task: 85/100 (The task was graph-based and I decided to make a C++ program with help of Internet)
IV task: 30/100
V task: 100/100 (The high score is a result of several days of thinking outside the box, I found the hidden scheme behind the task and implemented it to python code)
